    <p><h2><u>Making of Haleem</u></h2></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Rinse the whole wheat grains, barley, oats, and 
            lentils thoroughly, then soak them in water for at 
            least 4 hours or preferably overnight.</li>

        <li>In a large pot, heat the cooking oil or ghee over medium heat. 
            Add the thinly sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown.</li>  

        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot and cook for 
            another minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</li>

        <li>Incorporate the diced meat into the pot and cook until it's browned on all sides.</li>

        <li>Drain the soaked grains and lentils, then add them to the pot along with 
            enough water to cover everything. Stir in the garam masala, ground coriander, 
            ground cumin, ground turmeric, and salt.</li>

        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer,
            covered, for 4-5 hours, stirring occasionally. You may need to add more water 
            if the mixture becomes too thick.</li>

        <li>Once the grains and meat are tender and the mixture has thickened to a porridge-like
            consistency, remove the pot from the heat.</li>

        <li>Serve the haleem hot, garnished with chopped cilantro leaves, thinly sliced ginger, 
            and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the stew.</li>
        </ol>
